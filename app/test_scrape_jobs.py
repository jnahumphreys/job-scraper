        This test documents the uncovered lines in scrape_jobs.py for future improvement:

        Line 78: "Continuing without proxies (fallback enabled)" - logged when USE_PROXIES=True, 
                 PROXY_FALLBACK_ENABLED=True, but no proxies are available

        Lines 131-170: Proxy fallback retry logic - triggered when:
                       - There are proxies initially
                       - Scraping fails with proxy-related exception

                       - Exception message contains "proxy" (case-insensitive)

        Lines 193-195: Error handling when fallback is enabled but scraping fails

        These scenarios require complex mocking of the jobspy.scrape_jobs function
        and specific exception conditions that are difficult to reproduce in unit tests.
